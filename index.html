        <p> An article by Paulo Coelho titled "closing cycles" I read everytime I need to stay focused to start doing an important progress in my life.   </p>
      <p> "Nobody plays this life with marked cards, so sometimes we win and sometimes we lose.
      Do not expect anything in return, do not expect your efforts to be appreciated, your genius to be discovered, your love to be understood.

      Stop turning on your emotional television to watch the same program over and over again, the one that shows how much you suffered from a certain loss: that is only poisoning you, nothing else.

      Nothing is more dangerous than not accepting love relationships that are broken off, work that is promised but there is no starting date, decisions that are always put off waiting for the “ideal moment.”

      Before a new chapter is begun, the old one has to be finished: tell yourself that what has passed will never come back.
      Remember that there was a time when you could live without that thing or that person – nothing is irreplaceable, a habit is not a need.
      This may sound so obvious, it may even be difficult, but it is very important.

      Closing cycles. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because that no longer fits your life.

      Shut the door, change the record, clean the house, shake off the dust.

      Stop being who you were, and change into who you are."</p>
